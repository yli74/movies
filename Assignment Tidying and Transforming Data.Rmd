The chart above describes arrival delays for two airlines across five destinations.

#
1.Create a .CSV file (or optionally, a MySQL database!) that includes all of the information above. You’re encouraged to use a “wide” structure similar to how the information appears above, so that you can practice tidying and transformations as described below.

```{r}
# created a .csv file and uploaded on Github
Schedule <- read.csv(file="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yli74/movies/master/flights%203%202.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
Schedule
```
2.Read the information from your.CSV file into R,and use tidyr and dplyr as needed to tidy and transform your data.
```{r}
# According to "wrangling" on Rstudio, Tidy data needs to meet the following 3 requirements, 

# 1. Ech variable is saved in a column
# 2. Each observation is saved in its own row
# 3. Each "type"of observation stored in a single table

library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)

# View the dataframe and create names for Column 1 and 2
str(Schedule) 
names(Schedule)[1:2] <- c('Airlines','Status')
Schedule

Tidydata<-gather(Schedule, "cities","flights",3:7)
Tidydata

Tidydata1<-spread(Tidydata, Status, flights)
Tidydata1

# The new dataframe has met all requirements 
glimpse(Tidydata1)
```
3.Perform analysis to compare the arrival delays for the two airlines.

```{r}
# To compare the arrival delarys for the two airlines, we must get the ratio = delayed flights/ (delayed flights+on time flights)

library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)

Tidydata1 %>% 
mutate(ratio=delayed/(delayed+`on time`)) %>%
  arrange(cities, Airlines)
```
Overall, AM WEST has higher delayed rate than Alaska. If we look at the result by cities, AM WEST actually has lower delayed rate than San Fransciso.
